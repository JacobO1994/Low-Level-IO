# Low-Level-IO
A simple program written in x86 Assembly that implements numerical transformation from ascii to a numerical representation and back. The program implements data validation, logical jumps, and macro definitions. 

To test these functions, a sample program has been written that prompts a user to enter 10 numbers that would fit into a 32-bit general purpose register. The functions then transform these inputs to their numerical represenation and calculates various data from these numbers.

Overall, this was an assignment as part of a computer architecutres class. Going forward, if the need to write assembly arises again I think this code could be much cleaner and more concise. However, in it's current state.. its a hacked together program that works.
