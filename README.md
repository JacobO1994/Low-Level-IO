# Numerical-IO

A program written in x86 Assembly that implements numerical transformation from ascii to a numerical representation and back. The program implements data validation, logical jumps, and macro definitions. The enetered number should fit within a 32bit general purpose register.

To test these functions, a sample program has been written that prompts a user to enter 10 numbers that would fit into 32-bit general purpose register. The functions then transform these inputs with a sereies of macros and procedures to their numerical represenation and calculates various data from these numbers.

## Going forward
This program was an assignement from my computer architectures course and, with time constraints, the current format is more of a hacked together working soulution. If the need to write assembly agian in the future comes around I think this program could be a bit more efficiently written.
